DirectionHUD is a fully customizable Minecraft Fabric mod that enhances the vanilla navigation experience.
With the mod, you can save coordinates, track other players, see death locations, all with full customization with the **/hud** and **/destination** commands.

***Where does the mod work?*** - DirectionHUD both works on client and server, but for now the client side only supports single player & DirectionHUD servers. As with anything, that can change with time.
\
***How do I set custom destinations?*** - You can use **/dest set <XYZ>** to set a destination, but the main commands for the mod are **/hud** and **/destination**, if you are stuck try one of them out!
\
***Why does it feel like a plugin?*** - DirectionHUD was originally a plugin, but I am currently working on making it feel more like a mod!
