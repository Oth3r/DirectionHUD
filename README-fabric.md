\
DirectionHUD is a fully customizable Minecraft Fabric mod that enhances the vanilla navigation experience. 
With the mod, you can save coordinates, track other players, see death locations, all with full customization with the **/hud** and **/destination** commands.

\
***Where does the mod work?*** - DirectionHUD both works on client and server, but for now the client side only supports single player & DirectionHUD servers. As with anything, that can change with time.
\
***Why is it coded like a plugin?*** - DirectionHUD is a port of one of my old private plugins; Spigot port.
## Features
Press **H** to toggle the hud.

### Config Settings
Set config settings to set defaults when running on server, 
or use **[ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)** & **[YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)** when on client.
\
**/directionhud defaults** also works on the client - Set defaults to your current settings with one click!

## Future Goals
* Spigot port (95% done)
* More UI options
  * Custom client UI: Straying away from the plugin feel for client users.
  * Server inventory UI: Chat scrolling too fast? Want that classic inventory UI feel?
