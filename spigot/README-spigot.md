DirectionHUD is a fully customizable Minecraft plugin that enhances the vanilla navigation experience.
With the plugin, you can save coordinates, track other players, see death locations, all with full customization with the **/hud** and **/destination** commands.

***How do I set custom destinations?*** - You can use **/dest set <XYZ>** to set a destination, but the main commands for the mod are **/hud** and **/destination**, if you are stuck try one of them out!
